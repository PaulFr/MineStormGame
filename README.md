#MineStorm Game

C++/Qt game involving some spaceships and asteroids

====

As part of my C++ course, I have to create a game by using technologies such as C++ (No kidding) and Qt. The project is very simple. Only few features will be implemented :
- Moving spaceship
- Life counter
- Score counter
- Mines
- Gunshots
